## Introduction
In this project, we leverage the power of LSTM networks to predict stock prices. We use historical stock price data to train the model and evaluate its performance. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/ManaskrJha/TATA-STEEL-SHARE.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
sklearn
tensorflow


## Usage
1. Prepare your stock price data in a suitable format. Atleast the data should include a single column representing the stock price values. Make sur the Oldest data is at top and newest data is at the bottom

2. Run the .py file to train the LSTM model and generate predictions:

3. View the results and predicted stock prices.

## Results
The project provides the following results:
- Training and test data visualization
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) evaluation for the model's performance
- Actual stock price values plotted against predicted values

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
